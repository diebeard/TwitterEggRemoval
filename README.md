# TwitterEggRemoval

As this code sample uses what data is in the DOM you will need to log into your Twitter account, goto your Followers page and then scroll down your followers so they're loaded into the DOM and the code can action.

**Use this action to snap to the bottom of the screen.**
<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>â†“</kbd>.

So once you've either hit the end of your followers or had enough of waiting because you have lots of followers.

You now need to open Developer Tools and bring focus to the console: <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Opt</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.

Then copy and paste the script into the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

To know the script runs you'll be presented with an Alert dialog, this tab *may* become unresponsive but never fear, you can just open a new tab to continue other things.
